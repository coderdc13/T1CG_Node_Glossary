What is node.js? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js describes node.js at its simplest (to the editor) as a platform that “lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and to execute server-side scripting -- running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser.”
